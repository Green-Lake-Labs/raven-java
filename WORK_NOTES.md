API Keys are deprecated.

All DB ORM seems to be working.

Next steps:
- New API keys and/or APIs
- Database hydration testing
- Data structure testing
- Write the valuation formula(s)
- Experiment with valuation & data structures

Once finished, we launch a little Discord bot.
Perhaps we can restructure the repo so that all Raven components live inside (Discord, Service, CLI, UI).
